Cloud technology has certainly fastened the rate of advancement in comparison of the years when I started to learn to code.</p><p>The high demand of cloud related technology carries a lot of opportunity ranging from individual, startups and unicorns. The release of new frameworks and tooling happens almost every day. This push us a little more to catch up with technology every single day.</p><p>Learning itself is a skill, in which I believe that the more we share about something the faster we would understand and eventually master it.</p><p><strong>About Me</strong></p><p>My goal is to spread knowledge about various cloud concept and technology. I wanted to help as much as possible to get people understand a certain concept and implementation easier and quicker so they could solve problems. I am happy enough if I could help just one person to gain something from what I (would) write.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been working in enterprise software development for many years. I have experience in a various roles, such as sql developer, support, qa, java developer or devops engineer. The various experience helps me quite a bit to see things from many points of view.</p><p>I am currently working for Experian Malaysia as an Engineer. However, as a disclaimer, what I write here is rather my personal opinions/thougts and completely unrelated with my employer.</p><p>I am really passionate to share my knowledge about java, cloud technology, software development and IT in general. I would try to focus on the concepts and then the implementation.</p></article></section><footer><div><p class="f6 gray mt6 lh-copy">Â© 2016-19 <a href=https://github.com/siegerts/hugo-theme-basic>Hugo Theme Basic</a>.
